        <p>This tasty churro recipe is easy to make with basic ingredients such as water, white sugar, salt, flour, cinnamon, and more!</p>

            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Oil for Frying</li>
            <li>White Sugar (garnish)</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. 
                Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; 
                work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
